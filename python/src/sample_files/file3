The process of encoding JSON is usually called serialization. This term refers to the transformation of data into a series of bytes (hence serial) to be stored or transmitted across a network. You may also hear the term marshaling, but thatâ€™s a whole other discussion. Naturally, deserialization is the reciprocal process of decoding data that has been stored or delivered in the JSON standard.
