As you can see, JSON supports primitive types, like strings and numbers, as well as nested lists and objects.

Wait, that looks like a Python dictionary! I know, right? It’s pretty much universal object notation at this point, but I don’t think UON rolls off the tongue quite as nicely. Feel free to discuss alternatives in the comments.
